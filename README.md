# Introduction: 

Now that youâ€™ve landed here, I want to tell you that you can use this project to do a custom data load for your salesforce objects in salesforce lightning.

## Next Steps?

- Once you deploy the changes, there will be a custom metadata type named 'Monthly_Load__mdt' created in salesforce
- Make sure to create the records for the objects for which you want to create a data load.
- Initially the **LoadType__c** field will be having two predefined values namely 'Account' and 'Contact'.
- Make sure to add the **API NAME** of the object for which you want to create a data load in this field.
- In the **FieldName__c** field, add the name of the fields for the corresponding object which you want to come in csv template. Add them separated by comma.
- In the **FieldAPIName__c** field, add the api name of the fields for the corresponding object in the same order as done in **FieldName__c**. Add them separated by comma.
